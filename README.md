# Job Listings UI

A professional **Job Listings Interface** built using **React** to practice and demonstrate fundamental concepts such as **props**, **array mapping**, and **component-based architecture**.

This project simulates a real-world job board UI where multiple job cards are rendered dynamically from structured data.
